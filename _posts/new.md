Procrasinating work the other day, I started looking through my github repo to
clean the public repos up. Looking back through the code I had written 3-4 years
ago reminded me of why I started coding in the first place, to build cool shit.
It wasn't about building low level C projects for class or write apps that I
didn't understand for hackathons. It was just pure desire to build things I
found cool. I think that in the process of all this CS shit I lost sight of
that. The most important aspect above all.
